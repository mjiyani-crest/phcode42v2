    <h1>Code42 Phantom App</h1>

    <h2>py42</h2>
      <p>This app uses <a href="https://github.com/code42/py42">py42</a>, the official Code42 python SDK.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>This app implements various investigative actions on the Code42 Incydr platform. Additionally, this app
      ingests Code42 alerts into Phantom as events.</p>

    <h2>How to Configure the App</h2>
      <p>
        Access the Asset Settings tab on the Asset Configuration page. Input the cloud instance, username, and password
        to use to connect to Code42.
      </p>

    <h2>On Poll</h2>
      <p>
        The 'on poll' functionality first ingests the past 30 days of Code42 alerts. Note that if you use the "poll now"
        feature, you are limited to the number of containers and artifacts listed in the parameter fields. Adjust the
        polling interval in the ingest settings to determine how frequent polling occurs. The app ingests individual
        alerts only once unless a user deletes one of the corresponding events and the next poll includes
        the same alert, such as from 'poll now'.
